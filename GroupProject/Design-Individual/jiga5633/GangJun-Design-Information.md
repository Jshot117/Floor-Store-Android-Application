Design Information:

1. The requirement is realized through the Product class, which has an availability attribute representing the amount of product in stock by square feet.
2. The requirement is realized through the createProduct(), updateProduct(), and deleteProduct() operations in the Product class.
3. The requirement is realized through the FloorCategory class, which represents the different categories of floors available.
4. The requirement is realized through the Database class, which contains a collection of Product objects.
5. The requirement is realized through the one-to-many association between FloorCategory and Product, and the hierarchical list is represented as a tree data structure where each FloorCategory has child Product objects.
6. The requirement is realized through the getProductByKeyword() operation in the Database class.
7. The requirement is realized through the attributes of the Product class, including color, size, brand, type, and price.
8. The requirement is realized through the Material class, which represents the different materials used in tile or stone products, and has a many-to-one association with Product.
9. The requirement is realized through the WoodType and WoodSpecies classes, which represent the different types and species of wood used in wood products, respectively, and have one-to-many associations with Product.
10. The requirement is realized through the attributes of the Product class, including type and material, and through the use of subclasses such as WaterResistantLaminate and WaterproofVinyl.
11. The requirement is not directly considered in the design, as it is related to the user interface and not the software design itself. However, the design can be adapted to meet usability and responsiveness standards as needed.
