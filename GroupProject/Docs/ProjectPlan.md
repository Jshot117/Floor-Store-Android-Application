## 1 Introduction

The Floor App is a mobile application that allows customers and employess of flooring stores to browse and search for products in real-time. The application should also allow employees to modify the inventory of a store

## 2 Process Description

##### Inception: 
The initial stage in a software development process where the team comes up with an idea of what the final product should look like and what purpose it should serve.  During this stage, the team works to its objectives and goals, define the boundaries of the project and scope.
- Entrance Criteria: 
outlines of the general concept of what the final should look like and how it should function. this includes the purpose and objectives the the project.

- Exit Criteria:
A well-defined document that outline the objectives, contraints, and requirements of the project.should also include a list of features and functions the design should include. Agreement on the project team structure and roles and responsibilities.

##### Elaboration:
In this stage the team focuses on refining and detailing the design of the system. This involves the architecture of the system, specifying tools to be used, and creating detailed design documents that specify how the system will work.
- Entrance Criteria: Includes a document that  outlines the layout of the product. There should also be a list of requirements that should be met. This provides a good starting point for the design work that will be carried out.

- Exit Criteria: should include a detailed list of use cases. A document outlining the architecture and structure of the system, which includes details like hardware and software components and the data flows. there should be some sort of schedule and time line set as well. can also include a list of non-functional requirements of the system, such as reliability, performance and security. these must be met for the system to be considered usable. there should be a clear understanding of what the final product should look like and how it will work.

##### Cunstruction:
Is the stage where the team executes the the design to meet all the requirements. Testing will aslo be carried in this stage as the code is being produced.
- Entrance Criteria: To enter this stage, a document describing the architecture or structure of the system is required, and other documents that list the non-functional requirements and an outline of the project development.

- Exit Criteria: A fully functional system that satisfies all the requirements listed in the previous stages. A user manual for the client should be provided. Meeting all the non-functional requirements listed is not mandatory.


##### Transition:
This stage marks the process of transferring the completed version of the system to the user. The team will deal with the bugs and any issues that the user may encounter. The goal is to make sure user has a smooth experience with the new system.

- Entrance Criteria: The system must be complete, meet all the functional and non-functional requirements. A user manual should also be provided to help the user become familiar with the system.

- Exit Criteria: A completed product thats has resolved any initial bugs or problems that arose when user's usage of the system. Most, if not all of the non-functional requirements should also be met.
