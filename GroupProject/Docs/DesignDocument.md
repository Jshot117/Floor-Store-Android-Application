## 1 Design Considerations

### 1.1 Assumptions
We assume users are accessing the application with Android devices with Android API 24 or later version due the cumulative usage of users. The software will be dependent on the Nougat API and may not run optimally on older versions of Android. The software will be developed using Java.

### 1.2 Constraints
The application will be run on Android exclusive. There will not be an IOS, tablets or website version.

### 1.3 System Environment
The software will be developed for Android phone devices exclusively (tablets not included). The system must be able to interact with Android devices capable of receiving input through touch.
